# Solid-Oxide-Fuel-Cell-Solvers-in-OpenFOAM
This repository includes two SOFC solvers in both cell- and pore-scale, which are developed in open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) platform OpenFOAM.

If you feel these models and code are helpful for your research and project developmemnt, we will sincerely appreciate it if you could please cite the following journal paper and rate the repository with a star:

"An open source framework for advanced Multi-physics and multiscale modelling of solid oxide fuel cells. Energy Conversion and Management, 280, 15, 2023, 116791" which was implemented by Dr Wanhui Zhao and Dr Zhiqiang Niu.
